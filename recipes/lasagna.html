    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Filling and easy to make, lasagnas are great one-dish meals that check all the boxes, 
        as they can be filled with all sorts of veggies, sauces, and proteins, and can be adjusted to 
        many special dietary needs. Our red and white sauce lasagna is a flavorful combination of a 
        basic white sauce, rather than ricotta cheese, and a tomato-based sauce with beef and pork 
        that's flavored with spices and mushrooms. Covered in cheese and baked until golden, this is 
        a great weeknight meal served with a simple salad and crusty bread.

        We use oven-ready (also called no-boil) lasagna noodles to speed up the cooking time. 
        Simply assemble the lasagna with the uncooked noodles, seal it tight with foil, and bake. 
        As the sauce simmers, the noodles cook all on their own thanks in part to the moisture in the 
        sauces. The key is to keep the lasagna covered in the oven until the noodles are soft. 
        Removing the foil allows the upper layer of the lasagna to achieve an appetizing golden color. 
        The oven-ready noodles are also available in a gluten-free version if someone in your 
        household has special dietary needs.

        Although a few steps are required to complete this dish, the recipe is fairly simple and 
        can be a great first lasagna for novice cooks.
